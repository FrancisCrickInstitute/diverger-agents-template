"""Crick Bioimage Analysis Symposium (CBIAS) domain configuration for the pipeline.

Analyses four years (2022-2025) of attendee registrations, post-event feedback surveys, and abstract
submissions to answer year-on-year trend questions (see inputs/cbias_report/task_report.md).

The data this points at (inputs/cbias_data_anon/, produced by anonymize_cbias_data.py from the raw,
gitignored inputs/cbias_data/) has had direct identifiers - names, emails, phone numbers, precise
location, ticket barcodes/seats, submission authorship - stripped or generalised. See
anonymize_cbias_data.py's module docstring for exactly what was removed and why. A handful of Abstract/
References fields may contain a literal "[EMAIL REDACTED]"/"[PHONE REDACTED]"/"[NAME REDACTED]"
placeholder where something was scrubbed inline - treat these as ordinary text, not an error.

NOTE: `docker_image` below does not exist yet. This repo's Dockerfile only builds `bia-analysis:latest`
(numpy/scipy/scikit-image/scikit-learn/pandas/bioio/bioio-tifffile - no matplotlib). Build a
`cbias-analysis:latest` image with pandas, numpy, and matplotlib before execution-validation will work
for this config - same gap already documented for `trello_config.py`'s `python-analysis:latest`.

Analyse four years (2022-2025) of anonymised CBIAS data, in three sub-directories under the data
directory (or INPUT_FOLDER env var). This is anonymised data (see the module docstring) - some
identifying columns/fields present in the original raw data have been removed entirely; don't assume
fields like attendee name, email, or precise location exist.

- Attendees/CBIAS_<year>_Attendees.csv - one row per registration. Columns: Order date, Purchaser
  country, Event name/ID/start date/start time/timezone/location, Ticket quantity/tier/type, Currency,
  Ticket price, Guest. All four files are plain UTF-8.
  "Ticket type" holds the registration category: Academic, Academic - early bird, Industry,
  Industry - early bird, Online Only, Sponsors. Treat "X" and "X - early bird" as the same category X
  (e.g. match on a substring/prefix) when computing category distributions; "Industry" plus
  "Industry - early bird" together are the industry-participation signal.

- Feedback/CBIAS <year>Attendee Survey(...).csv - one row per respondent, one file per year (converted
  from the original Microsoft Forms xlsx export to CSV during anonymisation - read with
  pandas.read_csv, not read_excel). Each survey question appears as a real answer column plus two
  auto-generated companion columns ("Points - <question>", "Feedback - <question>") that are
  quiz-scoring artifacts and almost always empty - ignore columns starting with "Points - " or
  "Feedback - " and read the plain question-text column for actual responses. Question wording drifts
  slightly by year for the same underlying construct - e.g. "The ticket prices were appropriate"
  (2022-2023) becomes "The ticket prices were too high" (2024-2025), an inverted phrasing of the same
  question - match columns by keyword substring (e.g. "ticket price"), not exact text, and account for
  the polarity flip when combining years into one trend. Likert-style answers are free-text strings
  (e.g. "Strongly agree"), not numbers - map them to an ordinal scale before averaging.

- Abstracts/<year>_Abstracts/<n>_Abstract.txt - one plain-text file per submission, "Label: value"
  lines, where a field's value may wrap onto further lines before the next label. Author-identifying
  fields (Name, Email, Authors, Presenting author) have been removed from every year during
  anonymisation - do not expect them. Remaining fields present across all years: Institution, Title,
  Affiliation/Affiliations, Abstract, Keywords, Additional Keywords. 2024-2025 files additionally add
  "Themes" and "Gender of presenting author" (2025 sometimes also has "Special requirements"). Parse
  leniently by known field-label prefixes rather than assuming a fixed field order or a complete set per
  file - a few files also have one-off extra fields (e.g. "References", "doi"). The "Keywords" /
  "Additional Keywords" value is a Python-list-literal string (e.g.
  ["Segmentation","Object Tracking"]) with occasional stray "\\n" inside entries - strip whitespace after
  parsing.
