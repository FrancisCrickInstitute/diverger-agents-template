FIRST - IDEATION CRITERIA: the substance a candidate analysis IDEA must engage with, not whether
code runs. Identify:
1. The guiding questions or stakeholders the analysis should serve, if the report states them
2. Any anti-target list - analyses already explored, or explicitly out of scope - carried over
   VERBATIM where the report is specific
3. Data availability constraints relevant to judging whether an idea is even answerable
4. What "non-obvious" or "insightful" means for this report, if it says so

SECOND - DELIVERABLE RUBRIC: the concrete, checkable criteria a finished script must satisfy once
an idea has already been chosen. Identify:
1. What the script must compute/produce (metrics, tables, summaries, etc.) and how many/which, if the report specifies
2. What artifacts it must save to disk, if any (file types, minimum counts, naming)
3. Structural or presentation requirements the report states (console output format, labeling, etc.)
4. Anything the report explicitly says to avoid or keep out of scope, at the CODE level

If the report is silent on a dimension for either output, say so rather than assuming a default.
